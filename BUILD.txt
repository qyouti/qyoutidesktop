The source code repository contains NetBeans project files which means
that either NetBeans or Ant an be used to build the project. However,
the code is dependent on java archives from several other projects.

Linux:
On linux simply use your local package manager to install the following:

xml-commons-apis-1.3
xmlgraphics-commons-1.3
batik-1.7
batik-rasterizer-1.7
xalan-j2-2.7
xerces-j2-2.7

The NetBeans project is set up to point at jar files in their likely
installation locations but you may need to revise paths.

Windows:
You will need locate and download packages manually and edit paths
in the NetBeans project to point to the right jar files in the
right locations.


Both:
You may need to change the Java runtime used to build and run to a
named set of setting that you have installed in your NetBeans.

Packages that are less easy to obtain and install are bundled into 
the source code tree, namely:    ZXing, slf4j, jdesktop

Some tiny dependent packages are included as source code, namely
opencsv and jfontchooser.
